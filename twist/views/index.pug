      | TWIST, or Teen Women in Science and Technology, is a one-day conference to expose teen women across the state to various career possibilities. TWIST was developed by K-State Polytechnic and the Salina community more than 25 years ago. TWIST is open to any young woman in ninth through 12th grade. K-State Polytechnic encourages high school sponsors or organizers to register students. Students must register individually to choose their top six career sessions.
